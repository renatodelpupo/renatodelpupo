### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Working with the web since 2012, today I'm a front-end engineer, mainly with JavaScript-based development, focused on reactive frameworks like Vue and React.

Majored at Espirito Santo Federal University (UFES, 2017), I graduated with research in website design and development, exploring processes and discussing responsive web design, benchmarking, progressive enhancement, digital marketing, interaction design, user experience, and content management systems.
