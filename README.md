### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have been working with web technologies since 2012 and currently specialize as a Front-End Engineer, focusing on JavaScript-based development and reactive frameworks like React and Vue.

I hold a degree from EspÃ­rito Santo Federal University (UFES, 2017), where my research centered on website design and development. My work explored key areas such as responsive web design, benchmarking, progressive enhancement, digital marketing, interaction design, user experience, and content management systems.
